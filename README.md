The project is all about crafting a captivating landing page. Used HTML and CSS to bring this landing page to life, leveraging Sass for smoother development.

Clickable logos guide users to the top of the page for easy navigation. Hover effects add an interactive touch, while real links for phone numbers and addresses make communication and location access effortless.

Landing page is fully responsive, catering to various viewport sizes and ensuring accessibility across desktop and mobile devices. Form fields are thoughtfully designed, with required attributes and correct types (such as email and telephone) to guide accurate user input. Clear placeholders help users understand the expected format for each field.

When users submit the form, there's no page reload. Instead, form fields are cleared, ensuring a seamless user journey. Additionally, the footer is implemented as a sticky element at the bottom of the page, with a fixed background effect for added visual appeal.
